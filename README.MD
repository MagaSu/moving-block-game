# Moving blocks game

## Tasks

1. Add logic to the main character block
2. Add logic to the enemy blocks
3. Add logic to the game:
   Blocks cant move the arena
   Player loses, when he contact with enemy block
   If the player lasts for a certain time, then the difficulty increases.
   There comes more opponents.
   The player receives bonuses
4. Work on style

I'm now thinking how to give logic for each enemy block.
